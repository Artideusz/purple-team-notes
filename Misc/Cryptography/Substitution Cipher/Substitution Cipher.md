# Substitution Cipher

This cipher works by substituting letters of the alphabet with different letters (call it a kind of "letter mixing"). ROT-13 and caesar cipher are a sort of substitution cipher. A simple example of a substitution cipher would be:

```
Plaintext - ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Ciphertext- QWERTYUIOPLKJHGFDSAZXCVBNM

Plaintext - HELLO WORLD! THIS IS HOW THE CIPHERTEXT LOOKS LIKE IN ACTION.
Ciphertext- ITKKG VGSKR! ZIOA OA IGV ZIT EOFITSZTBZ KGGLA KOLT OH QEZOGH.
```

The cipher is sometimes used in the real world by, for example, salespeople to replace digits with letters.
There are different variants of substitution ciphers, one of them that stand out are the nomenclator ciphers.

## Nomenclator cipher
Nomenclator ciphers are a more difficult to decrypt than normal substitution ciphers, because not only the encrypter uses the substitution cipher with replacing letters of the alphabet with symbols or even words, but he also uses code words to get the substitution cipher symbols. An example would be:

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
QW1RTY2IOPLKJH58D3A4XCVB76 <- Can be letters, words, symbols or more commonly used in history, numbers.

Nomenclators:
E - Cryptography
S - is
N - a
F - very
Z - cool
G - field
U - Whitespace
M - World!

```

You can use multiple symbols for the letter substitution and/or for the nomenclators (code names).
