# OpenVPN

## What is OpenVPN?

OpenVPN is an open-source VPN toolset that enables us to access our own remote private networks. It works by creating an encrypted connection using keys that are used beforehand. Benefits of a VPN include:

- Access to the home network (printers, NAS).
- Bypassing network restrictions.
- Eavesdropping and MiTM prevention.

OpenVPN is also very flexible and feature-rich, allowing us to change a lot of settings and customize our OpenVPN instance how we like or need. OpenVPN supports a bunch of authentication methods, such as:
- X.509.
- User auth.
- X.509 and user auth.
